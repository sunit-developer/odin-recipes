# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin project.

It contains main index page and three other recipes' web pages, which can be opened from the index.html file's homepage.

It focuses on getting familiar with the most useful HTML elements, such as HTML boilerplate, <h1> etc. headings, <p> elements for paragraphs, <img> for images, ordered <ol> and unordered lists <ul>.

I also had a good practice on git commands, such as gid add, git commit, git push, git status and git log.
