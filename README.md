# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin project, called odin-recipes.

It contains main index page and three other recipes' web pages, which can be opened from the index.html file's homepage.

It focuses on getting familiar with the most useful HTML elements, such as HTML boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, images, anchor elements, and ordered & unordered lists.

I also had a good practice on git commands, such as gid add, git commit, git push, git status and git log.

********************** Update on Oct 14, 2024 ***********************

I added a css file to my project, to style it using the CSS.
I used the element and class selectors to do the following decoration:
-- "Verdana" as the main font, and "sans-serif" as the fallback font-family
-- Light cream color as the project background
-- Headings are of Dark Green color, center-aligned, and have a margin of 20px at the bottom
-- Level 3 headings are left-aligned, as opposed to center aligned like level 1 and 2 headings
-- Styled the Paragraphs, so that they are more readable
-- Styled the images. See the comments for further details

***************************** NOTE ********************************
I manually backed up the old unstyled project by the name of odin-recipes-unstyled
It is available in the same named repository on my local machine and in github
